# GuildMessageDemo
Demonstration to showcase a simple messaging service

My Process -
- After looking into multiple API's that can be used as a messaging service backend, I have decided to move forward with PubNub. This is because the initial setup to get basic messaging up and running looks relatively simple, and they have a free option (Which doesn't require a credit card) for up to 200 monthly active users or 1 million transactions. This is perfect for a demo like this, which I am treating like I would treat any sort of POC. Additionally, PubNub is HIPAA complient, so I can be pretty sure their security is up to standard.
- In my eyes, quick setup with easy to understand code/workflow are the two most important things for a POC. This way, my team can get back to me with feedback and we can more quickly see if the solution will work for our use case. This is why I have chosen to use an existing API (PubNub) to handle the more difficult back end code.
- For frameworks, I am chosing to move forward with Bootstrap and React. Bootstrap will allow for easy demonstration of the application accross all device sizes, and React will be used for a more personal reason. Because Guild as a company, and more specifically Laura's team, uses React in their daily technology stack, I want to start getting used to it now. This is not my first exposure to React, but its close. Because I'm pretty new to the technology, I wanted to try using it for this project, even if it made things a little more difficult, as I'll be learning a new framework as I go.

Things that Went Well -
- Bootstrap made the creation of my UI pretty easy, and it should display well across all device sizes.


Things that Didn't Go Well -

Other Notes -
- I used Visual Studio Code for my development, and it worked very well. I just recently started using VSC for development, and have been very impressed so far.
